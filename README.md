# ANGEL

Automation scieNtific data collectinG framEwork moduLe - acronym is just for fun

Currently supports:

*Generators:*
- Stanford Research Systems DS335
- Stanford Research Systems DS345

*Lock-in amplifiers:*
- Stanford Research Systems SR830
- Stanford Research Systems SR844
- Stanford Research Systems SR865

*Monochromators:*
- LOMO MDG-23 with custom stepmotor

*StepMotor controllers:*
- Electroprivod stepmotor controller SMSD-4.2

Somewhen multimetre, powermeter, temperature controller, ADC and ohmmeters will also be added. 

It is my main module that is used in my experiment automation programs. Unfortunately there are several generations of this module and there are some old programms as ANGEL-Shaman that needs quite old versions of it and I do not know if i will ever fix it.
